## What this means for you
Bandicoot currently allows any and all pasting from the user, regardless of the content of their clipboard.

If you'd like better control over what pastes are allowed or how to process the pasted content,
please make your voice known in [this Github issue](https://github.com/CanopyTax/bandicoot/issues/1).
